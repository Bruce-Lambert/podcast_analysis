In Final Cut Pro, you can automate edits using time-stamped data, but it requires some workflow adjustments. Here are your options:

1. Using an XML Workflow (For Bulk Edits)
	•	If you have a list of timestamps marking in/out points, you can convert them into an FCPXML file and import them into Final Cut Pro.
	•	This approach is great for automated segment selection, especially if the timestamps come from a transcript or external logging tool.

Steps:
	1.	Convert your timestamps into an FCPXML format.
	2.	Import the XML into Final Cut Pro.
	3.	The edits will be applied as per the timestamps.

Tools to help:
	•	You might need a script or tool to convert your timestamps into an XML that Final Cut Pro can read.

2. Using Final Cut Pro Markers (Semi-Automated)
	•	If your timestamps are from a text file or spreadsheet, you can convert them into markers and place them onto your timeline.

Steps:
	1.	Use CommandPost (a third-party automation tool for FCP) to batch-import markers.
	2.	Once markers are added, you can quickly create edits based on them.

Pros: Speeds up workflow but still requires some manual intervention.
Cons: Doesn’t fully automate the cut process.

3. Using AppleScript or Workflow Automation
	•	If you’re comfortable with scripting, AppleScript or Keyboard Maestro can help automate the manual process of cutting at specific timestamps.

4. Using a Third-Party App (For Subtitles or Cuts)
	•	If your timestamps come from a transcript or logging software (like Descript, Simon Says, or TimeBolt), some tools integrate directly with FCP to cut segments based on timecodes.

5. Manual Method (Least Efficient)
	•	If no automated method works, you can manually enter timecodes in the FCP viewer by pressing Shift + I and Shift + O to set in/out points.
