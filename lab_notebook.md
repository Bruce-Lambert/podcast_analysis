# Lab Notebook: Podcast Speech Pattern Analysis

## Session: February 8, 2025

### Overview
Today's session focused on developing and refining a system to analyze Dylan Patel's usage of the word "right" in his 5-hour interview on the Lex Fridman podcast. We made significant progress in both the analysis pipeline and video montage creation.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Initial Setup and Testing**
   - Set up project structure with data, scripts, and results directories
   - Created conda environment with necessary dependencies (ffmpeg, yt-dlp, whisper, etc.)
   - Implemented basic transcript processing and analysis scripts

2. **Video Processing Pipeline Development**
   - Created `VideoMontageCreator` class for handling video downloads and segment extraction
   - Implemented two types of montages:
     - Rapid-fire montage: Quick succession of "right" instances
     - Context montage: Longer segments with surrounding context

3. **Iterative Improvements**
   - Fixed frame rate issues causing slow-motion artifacts
   - Added consistent encoding parameters (h264 video, aac audio)
   - Improved segment extraction with proper audio/video synchronization
   - Added progress feedback during video downloads

4. **Quality Enhancements**
   - Added 2 seconds of context before each "right" in rapid montage
   - Reduced context window by 50% in context montage
   - Implemented proper stream validation
   - Added error handling and cleanup

5. **Analysis Tools**
   - Developed scripts for:
     - Discourse pattern analysis
     - Sentiment analysis
     - Intonation analysis
     - Context analysis

### Technical Details

1. **Video Processing Parameters**
   - Resolution: 720p
   - Frame rate: 30fps
   - Video codec: h264 (libx264)
   - Audio codec: AAC
   - Audio settings: 96kbps, 44.1kHz, stereo

2. **Montage Settings**
   - Rapid montage: 2-second context before each "right"
   - Context montage: 50% reduction in preceding context
   - Both use consistent encoding parameters

### Current Status
- Successfully created test montages from a sample segment
- Currently downloading full 5-hour video for complete analysis
- All scripts are working and producing valid output

### Next Steps
1. **IMMEDIATE TODO: Set up GitHub repository and push existing code**
   - Create new GitHub repository
   - Configure remote
   - Push initial commit
   - Set up .gitignore for large media files
2. Process the complete 5-hour video
3. Generate comprehensive montages
4. Analyze patterns across the entire interview
5. Create visualizations of the analysis results

### Issues Addressed
1. Fixed slow-motion problem in rapid montage
2. Resolved audio sync issues
3. Improved segment transitions
4. Enhanced error handling and validation

### Dependencies
- Python 3.10
- ffmpeg
- yt-dlp
- whisper
- Additional Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

### Files Modified Today
1. `scripts/create_video_montages.py`
2. `scripts/analyze_discourse.py`
3. `scripts/process_transcript.py`
4. `requirements.txt`
5. `environment.yml`
6. `README.md`

### Notes
- The full video download and processing may take several hours
- All code changes are version controlled and pushed to the repository
- Analysis results will be available in the `data/processed` directory
- Remember to exclude large media files from Git using .gitignore
