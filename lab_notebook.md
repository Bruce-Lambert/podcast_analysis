# Lab Notebook: Podcast Speech Pattern Analysis

## Session: February 8, 2025

### Overview
Today's session focused on developing and refining a system to analyze Dylan Patel's usage of the word "right" in his 5-hour interview on the Lex Fridman podcast. We made significant progress in both the analysis pipeline and video montage creation.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Initial Setup and Testing**
   - Set up project structure with data, scripts, and results directories
   - Created conda environment with necessary dependencies (ffmpeg, yt-dlp, whisper, etc.)
   - Implemented basic transcript processing and analysis scripts

2. **Video Processing Pipeline Development**
   - Created `VideoMontageCreator` class for handling video downloads and segment extraction
   - Implemented two types of montages:
     - Rapid-fire montage: Quick succession of "right" instances
     - Context montage: Longer segments with surrounding context

3. **Iterative Improvements**
   - Fixed frame rate issues causing slow-motion artifacts
   - Added consistent encoding parameters (h264 video, aac audio)
   - Improved segment extraction with proper audio/video synchronization
   - Added progress feedback during video downloads

4. **Quality Enhancements**
   - Added 2 seconds of context before each "right" in rapid montage
   - Reduced context window by 50% in context montage
   - Implemented proper stream validation
   - Added error handling and cleanup

5. **Analysis Tools**
   - Developed scripts for:
     - Discourse pattern analysis
     - Sentiment analysis
     - Intonation analysis
     - Context analysis

### Technical Details

1. **Video Processing Parameters**
   - Resolution: 720p
   - Frame rate: 30fps
   - Video codec: h264 (libx264)
   - Audio codec: AAC
   - Audio settings: 96kbps, 44.1kHz, stereo

2. **Montage Settings**
   - Rapid montage: 2-second context before each "right"
   - Context montage: 50% reduction in preceding context
   - Both use consistent encoding parameters

### Current Status
- Successfully created test montages from a sample segment
- Currently downloading full 5-hour video for complete analysis
- All scripts are working and producing valid output

### Next Steps
1. **IMMEDIATE TODO: Set up GitHub repository and push existing code**
   - Create new GitHub repository
   - Configure remote
   - Push initial commit
   - Set up .gitignore for large media files
2. Process the complete 5-hour video
3. Generate comprehensive montages
4. Analyze patterns across the entire interview
5. Create visualizations of the analysis results

### Issues Addressed
1. Fixed slow-motion problem in rapid montage
2. Resolved audio sync issues
3. Improved segment transitions
4. Enhanced error handling and validation

### Dependencies

- Remember to exclude large media files from Git using .gitignore 

## Session: February 11, 2025

### Overview
Today's session focused on consolidating code, improving the analysis pipeline, and setting up proper version control. We made significant improvements to the discourse analysis capabilities and added new tools for Final Cut Pro integration.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Code Consolidation and Improvement**
   - Merged two versions of `analyze_discourse.py`, combining the best features of both:
     - Advanced Whisper integration and visualization from newer version
     - Multi-speaker handling and context extraction from original version
     - Added normalized usage rate analysis
     - Implemented 5-minute window analysis for temporal patterns
   
2. **New Visualization Features**
   - Added four comprehensive visualizations:
     - Distribution of "right" usage over time
     - Sentence position analysis (end vs. mid-sentence)
     - Usage rate over time with 5-minute windows
     - Normalized usage rates (per minute and per 1000 words)
   - Enhanced visualization formatting with proper labels and grid lines
   - Added percentage annotations to bar charts

3. **Final Cut Pro Integration**
   - Created `create_summary.py` for generating structured summaries:
     - Formats timestamps in HH:MM:SS
     - Includes 5-second context before and 1-second after each instance
     - Generates clip names and context information
   - Implemented `create_fcpxml.py` for Final Cut Pro compatibility:
     - Generates valid FCPXML 1.9 format
     - Creates proper clip references and timing
     - Maintains video format specifications (1080p30)

4. **Version Control Setup**
   - Initialized Git repository
   - Created comprehensive .gitignore
   - Organized project structure
   - Pushed code to GitHub

### Technical Details

1. **Analysis Enhancements**
   - Added word count normalization
   - Implemented speaking time calculation
   - Added context window analysis
   - Enhanced multi-speaker support

2. **FCPXML Integration**
   - Format: 1080p30 (1/30s frame duration)

- FCPXML generation is ready for testing with Final Cut Pro
- All visualizations are saved in high resolution (300 DPI)
- Remember to test the FCPXML import with the actual video file 

## Session: February 11, 2025 (Afternoon Update)

### Debug Session and Working Configuration

After encountering issues with Python package imports, we identified the correct configuration for running the discourse analysis:

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Conda environment: `podcast_analysis`
   - Python version: 3.12 (from conda, not system Python)
   - Key packages: matplotlib 3.10.0, seaborn 0.13.2

2. **Working Command**
```bash
conda run -n podcast_analysis python scripts/analyze_discourse.py data/raw/pasted_transcript.txt
```

### Important Notes
- Must use `conda run` to ensure the correct Python interpreter is used
- System Python (/opt/homebrew/bin/python3) should NOT be used
- All required packages (matplotlib, seaborn, etc.) are properly installed in the conda environment
- This configuration successfully reproduces the analysis results from last night's session

### Analysis Results Verification
- Correct speaker word counts maintained
- Proper "right" usage analysis (Dylan: 24.40 per 1000 words)
- Accurate filtering of compound phrases
- Visualization generation working as expected

This entry documents the working configuration to ensure reproducibility of the analysis pipeline.
