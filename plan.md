I want to do an analysis of a podcast recording and transcript. I'm listening to a podcast and there's a guest that has a particular verbal tick. This verbal tick is not that unusual. It involves saying the word right at the end of an assertion. Say, they've used a lot of GPUs, right? So he says things like this. It's a podcast about AI. And this particular guest though has this verbal tick about as extremely as anyone I've heard and I want to document it. So I want to count the number of times in the transcript that he says the word right. And then I'd like to do some more complicated analyses. I'd like to count the number of utterances that end with the word right. And then if possible, for dramatic purposes, I'd like to edit the audio transcript with every time he says the word right. Now it's like a three-hour podcast and he says right hundreds of times. I'd like to edit the audio to have at least dozens of clips of him saying right, either the audio or the video. 
**Plan From ChatGPT:**
Here’s a step-by-step outline for identifying each instance of “right,” counting them, and then extracting those snippets from the audio (or video) with as little manual overhead as possible. You can adjust or skip any steps depending on the tools at your disposal or the exact outcome you want.

## 1. Obtain a Time-Stamped Transcript
1. **Get a transcript with timestamps:** If you don’t already have a fully time-stamped transcript (where each word or phrase is associated with a time range), generate one using a speech-to-text service. Popular choices include:
   - [Descript](https://www.descript.com/)  
   - [Adobe Premiere’s built-in transcription engine](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/speech-to-text-feature-premiere-pro.html)  
   - [FFmpeg with an external speech-to-text like Whisper, AWS Transcribe, or Google Cloud Speech]  
2. **Ensure word-level timestamps if possible:** Some services (e.g., OpenAI’s Whisper or AWS Transcribe) can output timestamps for each word or small chunk of text. This is crucial if you want to clip audio at each exact “right.”

> If you only have a transcript with paragraph-level timestamps, you can still locate rough segments, but you may need more manual trimming in the editing step.

---

## 2. Pre-process the Transcript Text
1. **Clean the text:** Remove extraneous punctuation, normalize casing, etc., to make counting instances easier.  
2. **Mark speaker segments:** If the transcript includes speaker labels (“Host,” “Guest”), verify the guest’s lines are clearly marked.

> If you must differentiate who said what, make sure the transcript solution or your script can handle speaker labels so you only count “right” from the guest.

---

## 3. Identify and Count “Right”
1. **Search for all “right” instances:** 
   - Count total occurrences in the transcript.  
   - For more nuanced counting, look for “right” that is preceded or followed by punctuation or end-of-sentence markers (e.g., “right?” or “right.”).
2. **Identify utterances ending in “right”:** 
   - You can detect this by checking if “right” is followed by a period, question mark, or next line break (or by comparing timestamps to see if a new sentence starts right after “right”).

> In code, you could do a regex approach for “\bright\b” to catch only the standalone word, plus a check for punctuation. Or if you have word-level timestamps, find when the next word starts more than a fraction of a second later, meaning the speaker paused or ended the sentence.

---

## 4. Extract Timestamps for Each “Right”
1. **Collect start-end times around each “right”:**  
   - Typically you only need the time when the guest starts saying “right” or a bit before it (to provide context if you want a bit of lead-in).  
   - Store these timestamps in a CSV or JSON structure like:  
     ```
     [
       {
         "start_time": 304.5,  // seconds from the start of audio
         "end_time": 305.1
       },
       ...
     ]
     ```
2. **Double-check potential collisions** if the guest says “right” in quick succession (less likely, but possible). You may need to handle overlapping segments gracefully.

---

## 5. Clip the Audio (or Video) for Each “Right”
1. **Use a command-line tool like `ffmpeg`:** 
   - For each timestamp, run something like:
     ```
     ffmpeg -i full_podcast.mp4 -ss [startTime] -to [endTime] -c copy clipX.mp4
     ```
   - Or for audio only (if the podcast is just audio):
     ```
     ffmpeg -i full_podcast.mp3 -ss [startTime] -to [endTime] -c copy clipX.mp3
     ```
2. **Automate with a script:** 
   - Create a short Python or shell script that iterates through the collected timestamps and automatically runs the `ffmpeg` command to produce a folder’s worth of short “right” clips.

---

## 6. Assemble the Montage of “Right”
1. **Concatenate clips in a single track:**  
   - Use `ffmpeg` again for a batch concatenate. For example, with an audio “concatenate” text file:
     ```
     file 'clip1.mp3'
     file 'clip2.mp3'
     ...
     ```
     and then run
     ```
     ffmpeg -f concat -i mylist.txt -c copy final_montage.mp3
     ```
   - For video, do the same with mp4 files or rely on editing software (Premiere, DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut, etc.).
2. **Adjust fade or transitions** if you want them. You might want quick jump-cuts for comedic effect or a slight crossfade.

---

## 7. Quality Check
1. **Listen back to the montage** to confirm you’re accurately capturing the “right” utterances—particularly for any edge cases (e.g., “all right” vs. “right now,” if you didn’t filter carefully).  
2. **Check if timing is correct**: If the transcript time alignment is even slightly off, you may need to shift your extracted segments by a fraction of a second.  

---

## 8. Optional Enhancements
- **Filter for specific contexts:** Only count “right” that ends a sentence, or that’s used as a rhetorical question.  
- **Add text overlays:** If you want a highlight reel in a video, add an overlay with “right” each time or highlight waveforms.  
- **Find synonyms or other filler words**: Use the same approach to track “like,” “you know,” or “uh.”

---

### Final Thoughts
- **Transcription Accuracy Matters**: The more accurate (and ideally word-level) your transcript is, the more precise your editing process will be.
- **Editing Software**: Tools like Descript let you highlight text in a transcript and instantly extract the corresponding audio/video segments. This could greatly reduce the manual labor if you’re comfortable with a GUI approach rather than scripting.
- **Automation**: If you’re fine with command line or basic scripting, you can do the entire pipeline with `whisper` (for transcription) and `ffmpeg` (for clipping), all orchestrated by a Python script that locates the timestamps of “right.”

Following these steps should give you a robust, mostly automated workflow to highlight this guest’s end-of-sentence “right” tic—complete with a montage for dramatic effect.

**Plan From ChatGPT continued:**
*I realized that the official transcript from the podcast had already edited out all the verbal tics. So we're going to have to re-transcribe the video from the YouTube link. I'm going to use the same workflow as before, but I'm going to use the YouTube link instead of the podcast. What follows are chat GPTs revised plan based on this new information.*

Not much changes in terms of *overall* workflow—it’s mostly that you now need to generate your own full, unedited transcript from the YouTube source (rather than using the podcast’s own edited transcript). Here’s how that modifies your workflow:

1. **Download the Audio/Video from YouTube**  
   - Use a command-line tool like [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) or `youtube-dl` to retrieve the file. For instance:  
     ```
     yt-dlp https://www.youtube.com/yourlink --output podcast.mp4
     ```
   - If the podcast is audio-only, you can extract just the audio track:  
     ```
     ffmpeg -i podcast.mp4 -q:a 0 -map a podcast.mp3
     ```
     
2. **Generate a Time-Stamped Transcript**  
   - **Automated Transcription**: Use a speech-to-text solution that supports word-level or phrase-level timestamps, such as [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper), AWS Transcribe, or Google Cloud Speech-to-Text.  
   - **Local Tools (e.g., Whisper)**:
     1. Install Whisper:  
        ```
        pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git 
        ```
     2. Run it against your audio/video file to get a JSON or TXT transcript with timestamps:
        ```
        whisper podcast.mp3 --model medium --output_format json
        ```
     - Whisper will preserve filler words like “uh,” “um,” and “right” in the transcript.  
   - **Cloud Services**: If you prefer AWS Transcribe or Google Cloud, just upload the file and ensure your transcription output includes timestamps for each word or segment.

3. **Return to the Same Counting and Clipping Steps**  
   - Once you have a raw, time-stamped transcript (with no editorial omissions), follow the same plan:  
     1. **Search** for each “right” in the transcript.  
     2. **Count** them, including how many times it ends a sentence.  
     3. **Extract timestamps** for each occurrence.  
     4. **Use `ffmpeg`** or similar tools to clip them out for a montage.  

4. **Speaker Labeling** (Optional Enhancement)  
   - If you want to *only* capture the guest’s “right” (and not the host’s), you’ll need to do a rough speaker separation. Options include:  
     - **Manual labeling** of the transcript after it’s generated (tag each paragraph/segment by ear).  
     - **Speaker diarization** from advanced services (like AWS Transcribe or Google Cloud with diarization on). This automatically attempts to label each speaker. You’d still need to confirm which speaker is the guest.  

5. **Check for Accuracy**  
   - Because you’re relying on automated transcription from YouTube audio, the speech-to-text might not be 100% perfect. A quick manual pass to confirm or correct “right” versus “write” or misheard words is usually helpful.

In short, the main difference is that you’re creating your own raw transcript rather than relying on an official one that might have filler words stripped out. Once you have that accurate, unedited transcript (and ideally with timestamps), you can apply the rest of the plan exactly as before.
